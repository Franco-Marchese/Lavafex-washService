## College assignment Lavafex.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This work was inspired by a work requested in one of my university courses. It consists of the development of a web page to modernize the service system of an old laundry that requires access to more customers, this simple front end mainly uses `React.js`.

Particularity:
  - This is my first development using `styles` for component presentation.
  - It has 2 main functions, which consist of **add one or more services to the cart**; In this, the second function allows you to **give visibility or not** depending       on the user's choice.
  - The cart has the ability to display, through a red bubble, the **detail of the number of services that have been selected** up to 9 items.
  
I consider that although I can continue developing extra features for the page, it is a simple development exercise to measure my abilities in the implementation of `React` for this type of development.

Thanks so much for reading.
